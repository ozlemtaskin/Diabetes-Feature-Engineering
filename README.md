# Diabetes-Feature-Engineering

# Aim

Developing a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. Perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model. 

# Information about the dataset

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. On Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA.
Data used for diabetes research. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.
